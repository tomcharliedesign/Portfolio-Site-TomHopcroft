        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Dinhero is a motivational money-saving app. By making savings funds, or Jars, dedicated to their specific goals, and setting their own time deadlines, users can easily see their progression over time.</p>

        <p>Dinhero implements gamification into it’s dashboards and provides users with tips, feedback and facts regarding saving and spending. </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <div>
        <h2>Project</h2>
        <p>This was the final project for the CareerFoundry intensive UX/UI Immersion course. For this project I was given a design brief requiring me to build a trustworthy money-saving tool that users can use to save money quickly for a
          particular purpose. The app needed to be able to track and monitor spending easily, and the key messaging was that the user does not need to be a financial expert to use the app.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <div>
        <h2>My role</h2>
        <p>My role in this project was complete ownership of UX and UI from start to finish.</p>
        <p>The deliverables for this project were:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>User flow diagram</li>
          <li>Wireframes</li>
          <li>User testing notes and results</li>
          <li>User interface design</li>
          <li>Desktop design</li>
          <li>Mockups</li>
      </div>
    </div>


    <div class="section">
      <div>
        <h2>User stories</h2>
        <p>Based on the design brief, I crafted three user stories to represent the user in the basic functions needed to use the app.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>See spending at a glance</h3>
        <p>As a user, I want to see a dashboard of my finances clearly and visually, so that I can see how much I am spending on what at a glance.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Motivational money saving</h3>
        <p>As a money-saver, I need to be able to input information on the money I am receiving and spending (and on what), so that I can see an overview of my finances.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Simple spending tracking</h3>
        <p>As a user, I want the money-saving tool I use to be motivational, so that I stay on track with my goals.</p>
      </div>
    </div>


    <div class="section">
      <div>
        <h2>User flow diagram</h2>
        <p>For each user story, I mapped out the general flow of screens the user would need to pass through to complete their goals. I was careful to not add unnecessary steps to the process and keep the flow as concise as possible to ensure an
          enjoyable and uncomplicated experience for the user.</p>
      </div>

      </picture>
    </div>


    <div class="section">
      <div>
        <h2>Wireframes</h2>
        <p>With the user flow diagram guiding what screens were needed, I created the low-fidelity wireframes with the basic and essential UI elements the user would need to navigate the app.</p>

        <p>Once the basic elements were established, the mid-fidelity wireframes could be created, fleshing out more of the UI elements. In this stage the design started to take shape, more screens were added that were not additionally considered
          such as a date selection screen stage to select the saving time-frame.</p>

        <p> Following the brief, I knew that I wanted some form of gamification central to the user experience when using Dinhero. It needed to be very easy to use and visual, and so came up with savings ‘Jars’ that fill up as the using is
          depositing
          more cash and getting closer to their goal.</p>

      </div>
    </div>


    <div class="section">
      <div>
        <h2>Prototype</h2>
        <p>After touching up my wireframes into a more complete representation of the final product, I used the screens to make a prototype using InVision in order to conduct a user testing.</p>
        <a href="https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/KNYYE22REXS#/screens" class="button" target="_blank">Use prototype</a>

    <div class="section">
      <div>
        <h2>User testing</h2>
        <p>Nine participants were gathered to test the main three functions of the app. They were each given the same three separate tasks to complete and were monitored throughout the session as they interacted with the interface to spot for any
          particular pain points.

          The users were asked to report back their own feedback on general difficulties; ease and intuitiveness of navigation; design and colour; typography; and responsiveness of clickable elements. The issues and difficulties were grouped and
          ranked in order of severity.</p>
        <h4>User tasks</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Navigate to spending dashboard and filter the view between the list and graphs and charts.</li>
          <li>Link a bank account with the app.</li>
          <li>Create a new savings Jar.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Key learnings</h2>
        <div>
          <h3>White space</h3>
          <p>Over 60% of participants commented that the original dashboard was too busy. Resizing fonts and graphics made for a design that was easier on the eye, and drew the user’s attention to the information they need.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Between the lines</h3>
          <p>Three of the participants commented that the statement screen was harsh to look at. I increased spacing, changed the body copy to a lighter grey and added green text to differentiate between saving and spending.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Right direction</h3>
          <p>80% of participants commented that the button labels were not specific enough, resulting in ending up on a screen that they did not expect. This was an easy fix and just a case of changing the copy of the button labels.</p>
        </div>
        <div>Once the key learnings were gathered, I went back to make amendments to the screens to ensure the best experience for the user from start to end. The final product is a user-friendly mobile savings app, optimised to motivate the user
          and ease the tracking of spending.</div>
